You can see the translation issues here. If you guys do not feel like doing on the teamgame.zealtechpos.com/ server, we can deliver this milestone now and start moving it on to our server and do the last translations there? I am ok with that, just let me know.


I think maybe the "task" should have the same name as on the back end, aka
Oppgave med bildesvar
Oppgave med tekstsvar
Oppgave med svaralternativ
Oppgave med skann QR,

in the navigation / menu on the field.

Understand? :)

====================================== Closing page
2. Insert (map or) last page
When clicking “avsluP now” – its sent to index.
Fine.
But I talked earlier about having a “closeing page”
aka when system sees all game are completed –
then it shows either a text page OR map with text.
This is more like a page to say game is over and
then should meet at place X. (thus the map)
Enough with text only like the instrucAon text,
but if a map is possible also great.
