You can see the translation issues here. If you guys do not feel like doing on the teamgame.zealtechpos.com/ server, we can deliver this milestone now and start moving it on to our server and do the last translations there? I am ok with that, just let me know.


I think maybe the "task" should have the same name as on the back end, aka
Oppgave med bildesvar
Oppgave med tekstsvar
Oppgave med svaralternativ
Oppgave med skann QR,

in the navigation / menu on the field.

Understand? :)
